local logger = require("logger")
-- Per-cover cache logging is verbose (one line per PUT/EVICT) and, because
-- Lua evaluates the string.format() argument before logger.dbg can discard it
-- at the info level, the format cost is paid on every cover even with debug
-- logging off. Gate it behind a constant so production pays nothing; flip to
-- true when diagnosing cache churn.

--
-- Why filepath-only: the same book renders into slots of different
-- dimensions across the UI:
--   * hero cover     (~500 × 750 typical)
--   * standard shelf (~250 × 375 typical)
--   * expanded shelf (slot_h grown by row budget; slot_w usually
--                     unchanged but can shrink on small screens)
--
-- A (filepath, w, h) cache key produced 2-3 entries per book and
-- defeated cross-mode hits — hero ↔ shelf transitions and
-- expanded ↔ standard toggles missed entirely. With a single
-- canonical entry per book, consumers below the canonical size let
-- ImageWidget downscale at paint time (MuPDF, Kindle-safe in this
-- direction — the corruption was upscale-specific).
--
-- Put policy: prefer-larger. On put, if an existing entry has at
-- least as many pixels as the incoming bb, the incoming bb is ignored
-- and the existing entry kept. If the incoming bb is larger, it
-- replaces. This means the FIRST consumer (often shelf) seeds the
-- cache at its size; HERO's later put overwrites with bigger; shelf
-- thereafter reads the larger hero bb and downscales. Stable.
--
-- Get returns whatever bb is cached. Consumers check the returned
-- bb's dimensions: if cached >= target in both axes, use it (with
-- ImageWidget downscale when smaller); if cached < target, fall
-- through to a fresh decode+scale (which will then replace the
-- cache entry per the prefer-larger rule).
--
-- Lifetime: the cache holds a strong reference to each cached bb.
-- Callers pass to ImageWidget with image_disposable=false. When the
-- cache drops an entry (eviction or prefer-larger replace) it just
-- nils its own reference — it does NOT call bb:free(). Other live
-- ImageWidgets may still hold the bb (e.g. a shelf SpineWidget whose
-- cover entry got upgraded to hero dims when the user tapped that
-- book into the hero); explicit free would yank C memory out from
-- under those widgets and the next partial repaint would render
-- garbage pixels. Blitbuffer sets up an ffi.gc finalizer at allocate
-- time (see ffi/blitbuffer.lua setAllocated(1)), so the C memory is
-- reclaimed automatically when the last Lua reference goes away.
--
-- clear() and remove() also don't free explicitly — they just drop the
-- cache's references and let GC do its thing. Existing widgets that are
-- still holding bbs keep working.

-- Resident byte size of a scaled cover bb. `stride` is the bytes-per-row of
-- the underlying C allocation, so `stride * h` is the true RAM footprint
-- INCLUDING any row padding -- and it scales correctly with both cover
-- dimensions and bit depth (1 byte/px on grayscale e-ink vs 4 bytes/px RGB32
-- on a colour panel) without the cache having to know the device type. This
-- is why the cache bounds memory by BYTES, not entry count: "128 covers" is
-- ~8 MiB of small grayscale shelf covers but could be ~150 MiB of large
-- colour hero covers -- the same number, wildly different RAM.
