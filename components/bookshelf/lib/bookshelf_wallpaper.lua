-- bookshelf_wallpaper.lua
-- A background image behind the whole screen, chosen PER SHELF.
--
-- ── WHY PER SHELF ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Every UI plugin that has wallpaper has one wallpaper. Bookshelf's unit is
-- the shelf, not the screen: a chip already carries its own view mode, folder
-- tile style, densities and spine settings, so a chip carrying its own
-- backdrop is the same idea one step further, and it is the reason to do this
-- at all rather than copy what already exists elsewhere (maintainer's call).
-- Genres can be a library, Recent can be a desk, and neither has to agree.
--
-- Three states, using the convention already established by the per-book
-- facts store and the chip pins, so there is one rule and not three:
--
--     a string   this shelf shows that file
--     false      this shelf shows NOTHING, even if the library has a default
--     absent     this shelf follows the library default
--
-- ── WHERE THE FILES LIVE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- <KOReader settings dir>/bookshelf/wallpapers/. Not icons/, where the
-- ornaments live: that folder was chosen because ornaments genuinely are the
-- small vector assets KOReader keeps there, and a full-screen photograph is
-- not. Other home-screen tools keep theirs the same way, beside their own
-- (settings/simpleui/sui_wallpapers), which is the convention a reader who
-- has used one is most likely to expect from the other.
--
-- ── WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- It does not decide whether a wallpaper is legible, or paint a scrim, or
-- know anything about the widgets it sits behind. It answers "which file,
-- and give me a widget for it at this size", and the shelf does the rest.

-- ── The page ground ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- What the screen is where no wallpaper reaches: the whole page when no
-- wallpaper is set, and anything a picture does not cover. Stored in the
-- same {grey=} / {hex=} shape as every other Bookshelf colour, so the shared
-- picker and its day/night key suffix work unchanged.
M.BG_SETTING = "wallpaper_bg"


-- ── Invert in night mode ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- OFF by default. A wallpaper normally looks the same by night as by day: the
-- panel inverts the whole frame and the picture is pre-inverted to match, so
-- only the chrome changes. With this on, the picture shows as its negative
-- whenever the shelf has its night look -- a pale texture becomes a dark one.
--
-- "Night look" is the shelf's theme (CoverProgress.theme), not KOReader's flag
-- alone: pinned Dark inverts it with KOReader in day mode, pinned Light keeps
-- it as drawn with KOReader in night mode.

-- ── Transparent buttons ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- OFF by default (maintainer's call). Chrome that goes see-through reads well
-- over a calm texture and badly over a busy photograph, and the safe default
-- for something that affects legibility is the one that keeps contrast. Covers
-- the shelf menu bar's chips and the hero's tag pills.

-- ── Chrome scrim ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- A solid panel behind the top panel and footer defeats the wallpaper, and a
-- border around each shape is not enough separation over a busy photograph.
-- What works is what a phone OS does: tint the strip, leave the picture
-- readable through it.
--
-- Blitbuffer gives us that for one C call. blendRectRGB32 composites a colour
-- OVER the rect at its alpha, via BB_blend_RGB32_over_rect, so the cost does
-- not scale with how many shapes sit on top. It subsumes the two states we
-- already had: alpha 0xFF is the solid fill, alpha 0 is transparent buttons.
--
-- NO DAY/NIGHT BRANCH, and that is not an oversight. The panel inverts the
-- whole frame in night mode and the wallpaper is pre-inverted to match (see
-- M.bg), so painted 0xFF is the page ground in BOTH modes -- white by day,
-- black at night. Tinting toward chrome_bg therefore always moves the strip
-- toward the ground colour the chrome was drawn for. Same reasoning as the
-- night card shadow's #D9D9D9.
M.SCRIM_SETTING = "wallpaper_chrome_scrim"

-- Fraction of chrome_bg to blend over the strip. Heavy rather than Medium:
-- 0.6 leaves the picture legible under the chrome, but "legible under" is not
-- the same as "legible", and which it turns out to be depends entirely on the
-- picture the reader chose. A busy or high-contrast one puts detail straight
-- through the chip labels. 0.85 still shows the picture through the strip and
-- is safe with any of them (maintainer: "safer legibility"). Anyone who wants
-- more of their wallpaper can turn it down; nobody has to discover that they
-- need to.
M.SCRIM_DEFAULT = 0.85

-- scrimStrength(read) -> 0..1
--
-- Transparent buttons is the zero point rather than a separate code path, so
-- there is only ever one question at the paint site: how much to tint.

-- _roundedSpans(x, y, w, h, r) -> a list of {x, y, w, h} rows that tile a
-- rounded rectangle EXACTLY ONCE each.
--
-- Blitbuffer has paintRoundedRect but no blended equivalent, and the obvious
-- workaround -- blend the body, then blend the corners -- is wrong: every
-- pixel in the overlap gets the tint twice and the corners come out darker
-- than the panel they belong to. Tiling by row means each pixel is written
-- once, so a 60% tint is 60% everywhere.
--
-- Rows only, no anti-aliasing. These panels sit on a 16-level greyscale e-ink
-- screen over a photograph, where a one-pixel stair step is invisible and a
-- feathered edge would just look like a smudge.
-- One table, reused, for the square case. _roundedSpans is called for every
-- panel and every band of the shelf recess -- several dozen times a frame --
-- and the square answer is always the same one-element list. Callers iterate
-- it and are done with it before the next call, so there is nothing to alias.

--
-- A drop shadow over a picture. Unlike scrim this DOES branch on night, and
-- the difference is worth stating because the two look like the same job.
--
-- A panel tints toward the page ground, and the page ground is one painted
-- value in both modes (0xFF), so scrim needs no branch. A shadow has to come
-- out DARKER THAN WHATEVER IS BEHIND IT on screen -- and "darker on screen"
-- is a lower painted value by day and a HIGHER one at night, because the
-- panel inverts the frame. Opposite directions, hence the branch.
--
-- Which is also why a shadow cannot be a fixed colour over a picture: the
-- shipped grey reads as a shadow on white paper and as a HIGHLIGHT over a
-- dark wallpaper, because it is lighter than the thing it falls on. Blending
-- pure black (or white) at a fraction is relative to what is there, so it
-- darkens anything.

-- per spine page), where shade()'s per-call wrapping WAS the cost.
--
-- Both forms refuse a buffer whose C blitter is unavailable

-- iconHasColour(icon) -> true if the icon's own artwork is chromatic.
--
-- IconWidget looks in `<data dir>/icons` BEFORE `resources/icons/mdlight`, so
-- "chevron.left" is whatever the user dropped there. Replacing the pagination
-- chevrons is a common thing to do and the replacements are often coloured.
-- Everything else in this file can treat an icon as black line art; the mask
-- cannot, because it has room for exactly one colour.
--
-- Read off the rendered bitmap rather than the file, because that is the thing
-- that gets painted: an SVG, a PNG and a scaled copy of either all end up here
-- as the same kind of buffer, and getColorRGB32 normalises every blitbuffer
-- type to r/g/b so the answer does not depend on which one it is.
--
-- TWO THINGS the naive version gets wrong:
--
--   * ALPHA. NanoSVG hands back STRAIGHT alpha, so the RGB sitting behind a
--     fully transparent pixel is whatever the rasteriser last left there --
--     frequently not grey, and never visible. Sampling it says "colour" for
--     every icon ever drawn. Skip anything close to invisible.
--   * TOLERANCE. A scaled or dithered greyscale render lands a channel a
--     point or two off its neighbours. Require a real spread, not inequality.
--
-- Sampled on a stride so the cost is ~256 reads whatever the icon's size, and
-- cached against the RESOLVED PATH -- which is the field that distinguishes a
-- user's chevron.left from the shipped one of the same name. The answer is a
-- property of the file, so once per session is once too many already.

--
-- For the shelf's own dark theme, where nothing inverts the frame for us and
-- KOReader's icons are black-on-transparent bitmaps with no colour to set.
--
-- MASKED, not inverted. ImageWidget has an `invert` flag, and it is the wrong
-- tool here: it inverts the icon's whole RECT, so the panel showing through
-- the transparent part flips too and every chevron gains a pale box -- which
-- is exactly what it looked like. The mask takes the pixmap as an alpha
-- stencil and colour-blits it, leaving everything around the glyph alone.
--
-- Same wrapping unfill uses for a DISABLED icon: replace the widget inside
-- Button's label_container, since that is what actually gets painted.
--
-- SKIPPED for an icon that carries colour. KOReader resolves icons from the
-- user's own `<data dir>/icons` before its own set, so the chevron here may be
-- a cat paw somebody drew -- and a mask has exactly one colour. Flattening
-- stock black line art is the whole point; flattening a painted icon is just
-- deleting it. So ask the bitmap first.
-- tintIcon(ink, icon) -> the icon, or a stand-in that paints it in `ink`.
--
-- The rule recolourIcons applies, lifted out so it can be pointed at a bare
-- IconWidget as well as at a Button's. KOReader icons are black-on-transparent
-- bitmaps and take no colour from anyone: an `fgcolor` handed to the widget
-- that builds one is simply ignored. That is fine while the surface behind is
-- white, and it is why a micro-module can pass the right ink to its icon and
-- still paint black on a black card.
--
-- ALWAYS returns something paintable, so a caller can assign the result
-- unconditionally. It hands the original straight back when there is nothing
-- to do:
--   * no ink, or not an alpha bitmap -- nothing to recolour;
--   * an ink that is already black -- the artwork is drawn in it, so a mask
--     render would cost a buffer to change nothing;
--   * a COLOUR icon -- mask is an alpha stencil with one fgcolor, so it would
--     flatten the artwork to a silhouette. iconHasColour is that test.

-- nightProofIcons(night, ...) -> the same widgets, so it can wrap a list

--
--     if Screen.night_mode and self.original_in_nightmode and not self.is_icon
--
-- For black line art that exemption is the whole trick -- paint black, display
-- white, match the text. For a colour icon it is simply wrong, and upstream
-- says so in the comment directly above that line: "As for *color* icons, we
-- really *ought* to invert them here, but we currently don't, as we don't
-- really trickle down a way to discriminate them from the B&W ones."
--
-- iconHasColour IS that discrimination, so do what the note asks. Inverting
-- here means the icon DISPLAYS the colours its author chose, in both modes --
-- never a negative of them, which is the one outcome nobody wants.
--
-- A PRIVATE COPY, never the widget's own buffer: `_bb` normally belongs to
-- ImageWidget's render cache, shared with every other widget showing the same
-- icon at the same size. Inverting it in place would flip those too, and flip
-- them again on the next rebuild.
--
-- The RGB32 invert masks 0x00FFFFFF in both the Lua and the C path, so the
-- alpha channel survives and the glyph keeps its shape. That only holds for a
-- buffer that still HAS an alpha channel: with no wallpaper up, ImageWidget
-- caches the icon already flattened onto white (`if self.is_icon and not
-- self.alpha`), and inverting that gives a black card. So this is gated on
-- alpha being on, which is the state unfill puts these icons in.

-- mask(active, inner, fgcolor) -> a widget, or `inner` untouched.
--
-- The answer to the one surface a wallpaper cannot simply be placed behind:
-- text. TextBoxWidget renders into its own buffer, fills it with bgcolor
-- (white) and blits it OPAQUELY; the HTML widgets are worse still, because
-- MuPDF hands back a page, not a picture with holes in it. Neither has a
-- transparent mode.
--
-- But an opaque render of dark text on a white page IS a glyph-coverage mask,
-- just the wrong way round. colorblitFrom uses the source's 8-bit grey VALUE
-- as alpha (setPixelColorize: `local alpha = mask:getColor8().a`), so:
--
--     paint the widget onto white  ->  glyphs dark, page white
--     invert                       ->  glyphs bright, page black
--     colorblitFrom(mask, colour)  ->  glyphs painted, page contributes 0
--
-- Anti-aliasing survives intact, because a half-covered edge pixel becomes a
-- half alpha. Measured against real blitbuffers before this was written: an
-- edge at grey 201 over a ground of 71 came out at exactly 56 in black and
-- 110 in white, both matching the arithmetic to the integer.
--
-- fgcolor defaults to BLACK because this plugin paints in PRE-INVERT space:
-- black here displays white once the panel inverts in night mode, which is
-- the same rule the rest of the shelf follows.
--
-- THE LIMIT, worth knowing before using it somewhere new: a mask has one
-- colour. Bold and italic survive (they are glyph shapes) but anything that
-- relied on being a DIFFERENT colour is flattened to a density of this one.
-- For book text -- prose, outlined pills, a progress bar -- that is fine.
--
-- The mask is built once per wrapper instance and kept. These wrappers are
-- created by a layout build and die with it, so that is once per rebuild
-- rather than once per frame.
