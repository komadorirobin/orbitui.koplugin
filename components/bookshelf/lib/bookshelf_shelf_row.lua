-- Each slot can be a SpineWidget (single book) or a SeriesStack (series group).
-- Empty slots render as blank spacers so the row always has a fixed width.

-- The dotted base rule is a custom-painted Widget subclass. Its paintTo method
-- walks pixel columns 3dp apart and draws a 1×thickness fillRect at each stop.
-- Pattern reference: bookends_overlay_widget.lua lines 176–185 (MultiLineWidget).
