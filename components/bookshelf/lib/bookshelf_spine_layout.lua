-- bookshelf_spine_layout.lua
-- Pure geometry for the "spines" shelf style: books stood on a shelf edge-on,
-- like a real bookcase. No widgets, no Screen, no i18n -- everything here is
-- a function of plain numbers so the whole layout is testable headless.
--
-- NOT to be confused with lib/bookshelf_spine_widget.lua, which despite its
-- name is the COVER TILE (one book's front cover on the cover-grid shelf).
-- That name predates this view. This module is the spine view's maths.
--
-- ── THE MODEL ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
--   width   <- page count. A thick book is a wide spine. Unknown page count
--              gets a typical-paperback default rather than a degenerate
--              sliver, because most libraries have SOME books the scanner
--              never opened.
--   height  <- the cover's true aspect ratio (h/w). A tall cover is a tall
--              book. All spines stand on the shelf baseline; tops vary,
--              exactly like a real shelf.
--   face-out<- a favourite can face outwards (front cover shown, bookstore
--              style). Its slot width is then the cover width at spine
--              height, not the page-count width.
--
-- Pagination is greedy fill: pack spines left to right until the shelf row
-- is full, then start the next row; a page is n_rows rows. Pages therefore
-- hold a VARIABLE number of books -- the footer must say "10-13 of 324",
-- not "page 3 of 27 x 12".

SpineLayout.MAX_PAGES     = 1200 -- everything thicker renders at MAX_W_DP

-- read "a bit thin" (user), and the default-pages book in particular. The

--
-- Exposed, and the face-out planner subtracts the SAME value, because the two
-- have to agree: a face-out and a spine-out of the same book are the same
-- physical object, so their front faces must be identical on screen. They
-- were not -- the face-out subtracted its own (much smaller) thickness
-- instead, which left its cover taller than the neighbouring spine by very
-- nearly that spine's whole top edge. Device report: "the face out cover is
-- as tall as the spine plus its pages top box".
--
-- What legitimately differs is the top box ABOVE the front face: a spine-out
-- shows its cover width up there, a face-out only its thickness. So a
-- face-out's total silhouette is genuinely SHORTER, and the space it leaves
-- at the top of the row is correct rather than a gap to fill.

-- fillRows(widths, avail_w, gap, empty_ok) -> { {first=i, last=j}, ... }
--
-- Greedy left-to-right fill. A row normally holds at least one book even when
-- that book alone is wider than the shelf (it gets clipped by the painter
-- rather than looping forever here).
--
-- avail is called as avail(row_index, first_book_index) -- the book that will
-- start that row. The shelf needs it to identify a PAGE by its first book
-- rather than by a page ordinal: the ordinal reaches the render through a
-- lookup that can be stale, and when it is, two different pages plan as the
-- same one and get the same ornaments (device log: two renders, different
-- books, both `page_index=3`). The book is the page's own, so it is right by
-- construction in both planning passes.
--
-- empty_ok(row_index) lifts that for one row at a time: answer true and a row
-- whose remaining width cannot seat even its first book is emitted EMPTY
-- (last = first - 1) and the book tries again on the next row. The shelf uses
-- it for a row carrying a wide ornament: reserving 85% of the row and then
-- seating a face-out cover in what was left put the cover past the end of the
-- plank (device report, "a face out book appearing off the edge of the
-- shelf"). A row may stand as its ornament alone -- "we don't always need to
-- have a book" -- but never two empty rows running, so a book wider than any
-- row still lands somewhere instead of looping.
--
-- gap is either one number, or an array where gap[i] is the gap painted
-- BEFORE book i (so a group boundary can be wider than the gap inside a
-- run). A book that starts a row carries no leading gap either way.
-- avail_w: one number, or a function(row_index) -> width, for a shelf whose
-- rows are not all the same width -- a row carrying an ornament at its end
-- gives up exactly that piece's width, and no other row gives up anything.
-- Called with 0 for "nothing reserved" (the widest a row can be).

-- ── Balanced row breaking ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Greedy fill packs the most books it can into the rows available, which is
-- exactly what pagination needs -- but it dumps every scrap of leftover space
-- onto the last row, and rows are painted CENTRED. Sixteen books on a two-row
-- shelf come out as fifteen books and one marooned mid-plank.
--
-- balanceRows re-breaks the SAME books across the SAME number of rows, so
-- nothing the fill decided moves: the page's book set, `shown`, the cursor
-- step, the footer's "10-13 of 324". Only where the breaks fall.

-- How far the balancer will shift a break, measured in average books, to
-- avoid cutting a section in half. The unit comes out of the arithmetic:
-- moving a break by one book of width w off an even split costs exactly
-- 2*w^2 of squared slack, whatever the slack happens to be. So "two books"
-- is 2 * (2 * mean_w)^2, and the constant reads as what it buys instead of
-- as a magic number of pixels.
SpineLayout.RUN_BREAK_BOOKS = 2

-- balanceRows(widths, avail_w, gap, count, n_rows, opts) -> rows | nil
--
-- Breaks widths[1..count] into exactly n_rows rows, minimising the sum of
-- squared row slack. gap works as in fillRows: one number, or an array where
-- gap[i] is painted BEFORE book i and is dropped when book i starts a row.
--
-- opts.runs[i] is the id of the section book i stands in (on a grouping chip,
-- the flattened group's item index). A break landing INSIDE a section is
-- charged RUN_BREAK_BOOKS' worth of slack, so the balancer gives up a little
-- evenness to keep a series or an author's shelf together. A preference, not
-- a rule -- a break that would strand a book still wins. Sections too wide to
-- stand on one row are exempt: they get cut wherever the breaks land, so
-- charging for it would only buy a lopsided shelf.

-- books, or no partition fits -- and the caller keeps the greedy rows.
