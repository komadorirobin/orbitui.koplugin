-- bookshelf_spine_shelf.lua
-- The "spines" shelf style: books stood edge-on along a shelf line, the way
-- a real bookcase presents them. Width from page count, height from the
-- cover's true aspect, colour from the cover's average tone, the title
-- running up the spine, the series number printed level at the foot the way
-- an encyclopedia set numbers its volumes. Favourites can face outwards
-- (front cover shown), bookstore style.
--
-- NOT lib/bookshelf_spine_widget.lua: that file, despite its name, is the
-- COVER TILE of the cover-grid shelf and predates this view. The pure
-- geometry for this view lives in lib/bookshelf_spine_layout.lua.
--
-- ── Night mode ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Night mode inverts the framebuffer at refresh, so every colour derived
-- from a cover is painted PRE-INVERTED (fill and text together) to display
-- as itself -- the same constantInNight treatment stack_display's ribbon
-- uses. The shelf line is UI chrome and inverts with the rest of the UI.

-- One pair of angles drives every scale, so the face and the top move like
-- one rigid book instead of two tuned constants (user report: the fudged
-- 0.80 squash + arbitrary top growth didn't convince). Orthographic camera
-- pitched down by ALPHA (the same slightly-above viewpoint the standing
-- shelf implies: a spine of thickness D shows a top edge of D*sin(ALPHA),
-- which matches the standing page blocks at ALPHA ~= 12 deg). The book tips
-- forward by THETA about its bottom-front edge, so:
--   face height  scales by cos(ALPHA+THETA)/cos(ALPHA)
--   top depth    scales by sin(ALPHA+THETA)/sin(ALPHA)
--   and the tipped top edge is directly D*sin(ALPHA+THETA), where D is the
--   book's on-screen thickness -- the spine's WIDTH -- so fat books tip to
--   show broad tops and novellas barely any, with no separate rule.
-- ALPHA = 12 deg, THETA = 26 deg (face scale ~0.81, close to the 0.80 the
-- user calibrated by eye):

-- The STANDING books' visible tops, from the same camera: a horizontal depth
-- d projects to d * sin(ALPHA) of screen height. What that depth IS differs
-- by how the book stands (user ruling): a face-out shows its THICKNESS above
-- the cover (page count), a spine-out shows its COVER WIDTH above the spine
-- (the book is turned 90 degrees, so its depth into the shelf is the cover).
-- Before this the face-out used an arbitrary 0.3 x thickness and the spine a
-- flat 5% of its height, so face-outs read as thick as spines were wide.
-- Single-sourced in lib/bookshelf_spine_layout.lua so the planner (which
-- sizes a face-out) and the painter (which carves a spine's top edge) cannot
-- drift apart. Kept as a field here because callers already read it.

-- The gap a FACE-OUT needs against anything it isn't serially attached to:
-- covers standing 2dp apart read as one slab (obvious once "All books"
-- face out). Between the book gap and the group gap on purpose -- group
-- boundaries must still read as the wider break. A face-out followed by
-- its own series' SPINES keeps the tight book gap: that adjacency is what
-- shows the run belongs to it (user ruling).
SpineShelf.FACE_GAP_DP = 12

-- The shelf recess (see rowWidget): how far up the books' stand height the
-- darkening reaches, how many bands it is built from, and how dark it gets at
-- the feet. Subtle on purpose -- this is meant to read as depth, not as a grey
-- stripe behind the books.
-- SpineShelf.fillLiftGap(bb, x, y, w, h) -- fill the space a lifted book
-- leaves on the shelf, by stretching the one-pixel column just LEFT of it
-- across the whole gap (the maintainer's design).
--
-- It replaced two looks. Over a wallpaper a solid black box: a translucent
-- ramp whose alpha the device's BB8A slot buffer dropped, kept because it
-- read clearly, and reported as "a thick black bar" (#446). On a plain page a
-- banded reproduction of the plank with full-strength strips down each side,
-- which never matched the plank around it. Whatever the shelf paints beside
-- the book -- recess, plank bands, front face -- now carries straight through
-- the gap row by row, so it is continuous with its surroundings by
-- construction. Night mode needs nothing of its own: the pixels copied are
-- already the right way round.
--
-- The column has to be read off the DESTINATION, after the row and every
-- book to the left have painted. A slot's cached render is a buffer of its
-- own (empty over a wallpaper, page ground otherwise) with nothing to the
-- left in it to copy -- so the render leaves the gap alone and says where it
-- is, and each path that draws a lifted book calls this after its blit.
--
-- WHERE the column comes from is the caller's to say (from_x), because "just
-- left of the gap" is only shelf for a FACE-OUT, which has face_gap either
-- side. Spines in a run stand flush -- the plan leaves them no gap -- so the
-- pixel left of a lifted spine is the next book, and stretching it paints a
-- band of that book (maintainer, on seeing it). A spine passes the column just
-- left of its whole flush block instead (flush_dx, from rowWidget). Omitted,
-- it is x-1.
--
-- A column that is off the buffer, or would be inside the gap itself, falls
-- back to the one just right of the gap. Clipped to the buffer; a gap with no
-- shelf on either side is left as it is.

--
-- THE 45-DEGREE RULE, applied between books as well as past the ends of a
-- run. A book's shadow does not stop at its own edge and it does not extend
-- sideways at full height either: it leans over whatever is next to it and
-- falls away one pixel per pixel travelled. So the horizon at any point is
-- the tallest of (each book's height minus the distance to it).
--
-- A flat neighbour-max was tried here once and rejected -- the painter's own
-- comment records why: a short spine took a face-out's FULL shadow height
-- and the cover's outline stopped reading. This is not that. The tall book's
-- influence is gone again within its own height, so the outline survives and
-- the square step between the two does not.
--
-- Distance is measured to the first clear pixel on the right and to the
-- book's own first pixel on the left, so the two sides differ by one pixel
-- at the boundary. That is deliberate rather than worth a branch: one pixel
-- at the foot of a rake nobody can point at.
-- `field` picks what is being raked: "h" (default) is the shadow's TOP, the
-- shoulder it stands at; "foot" is its BASE on the plank. A face-out stands
-- one inset further back than the spines beside it, so its foot sits higher
-- up the board, and the gap between them used to drop square to the spines'
-- foot line hard against the cover. Same rule, same 45 degrees, other edge.
-- `reach` caps how far sideways a book's shadow is allowed to carry. Without
-- it a 250px spine ramps for 250px, which is both further than a shadow goes
-- and far too long to draw: the slices that have to render the diagonal get
-- spread over the whole run and come out as steps you can count -- most
-- obvious across a gap holding an ornament, which is the widest gap a row has
-- (maintainer). Same reach the end-of-run wedge uses, so a shadow travels the
-- same distance whether it leaves the run sideways or past its end.

-- ── Plank designs (theme packs) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- A pack's plank design: three images the same height (middle repeated across
-- the row, left and right drawn over it at the ends), each three equal bands:
-- the top third ABOVE the plank (snow drifts up the back, behind the books),
-- the middle third the plank EXACTLY (surface top to front-face bottom), the
-- bottom third BELOW it (icicles). Drawn over Bookshelf's own plank, so
-- transparent parts show the reader's plank colour. See bookshelf_theme_pack.
--
-- THE TEMPLATE RULES (maintainer's spec, 2026-09-26):
--   plank.middle.png covers the ORIGINAL plank exactly: tiled from its left
--   end, clipped at its right end, Bookshelf's own corner bevels cut into it,
--   so switching a design on changes the material and never the outline.
--   Its middle third splits 80/20: the top 80% is the plank's top surface,
--   the bottom 20% its front face. Each part is fitted to Bookshelf's own
--   surface and face height, because their ratio changes with the row height
--   (measured 2.7:1 to 5.3:1 on a PW5), and a uniform scale would put the
--   art's front edge somewhere other than where the books stand.
--   plank.left/right.png are drawn over it, flush with the screen edges --
--   or, when the file says bookshelf:plank_end=N (px in from its outer edge
--   where the art's plank ends), placed so that point is the real plank end,
--   which is the only way one image lines up on every screen: the margin
--   between screen edge and plank does not grow with the plank.
--
-- The share of a plank design's middle band that is the top surface; the
-- rest is the front face. Part of the template: pack art is drawn to it.

-- -> strip, top_h: the whole design composed across `width` (the screen, or
-- the row alone offscreen), middle clipped to the plank with its bevels cut,
-- ends over it. Pre-inverted for an inverting frame, like the ornaments.
-- alphaRegions(w, h, alphaAt) -> { {x, y, w, h, solid}, ... }: the parts of
-- a w x h image worth painting, as few rectangles as it can: rows (and runs
-- within them) that are fully transparent left out, fully opaque runs marked
-- solid (a plain copy), the rest to be alpha-blended. Consecutive rows with
-- the same runs merge into one rectangle.
--
-- Why: a plank design strip is the full screen width by three bands, and
-- blending all of it on every row at every paint was ~20% of a spine-shelf
-- tap on a PW5 (profile, 2026-09-28). Its top band is usually empty (it sits
-- behind the books) and its middle band solid wood, so most of that blend
-- was work with no effect. A strip too fragmented to be worth splitting (more
-- than MAX_ALPHA_REGIONS pieces) comes back as one rectangle to blend.

    -- view -- light does not reach behind the books.
    --
    -- So: darken the ground just behind where the books stand, strongest at
    -- their feet and fading up. Banded rather than a true gradient, the same

    -- e-ink, and 16 greys cannot show a smooth ramp anyway.

    -- Painted between the plank and the books, so the books cover most of it
    -- and what shows is the gaps between them and the air above -- which is
    -- exactly where a shelf reads as deep.

    -- they did not have. It reads better than that: the depth is what makes
    -- the shelf a shelf, and it is just as welcome on a plain background
    -- (maintainer, comparing the two side by side). Wallpaper.shadeRect never
    -- needed a picture anyway -- it is a darken on whatever pixels are there.
