-- bookshelf_ornaments.lua
-- Ornaments: user-supplied SVGs that stand in the gaps of a spine shelf, the
-- way a shop dresses a half-empty shelf with a plant or a figurine.
--
-- Deliberately undocumented -- a thing to find. The first spine render creates
-- <KOReader data dir>/icons/bookshelf.ornaments/ holding template.svg (a
-- potted plant, carrying the conventions in its comments) and cactus.svg; both
-- are ordinary ornaments, and any *.svg or *.png dropped beside them joins the
-- pool. The template's comment block is the whole documentation, so anything
-- a reader needs to know has to end up in there.
-- The template is written only when the folder is first created -- a user who
-- deletes the plant keeps it deleted.
--
-- INSIDE icons/ on purpose. That is KOReader's own user-asset directory (see
-- iconwidget.lua, which prepends <data dir>/icons to its search path), so it
-- is where a reader already goes to manage SVGs of their own. A
-- bookshelf.ornaments/ folder in the root of KOReader's storage would be one
-- plugin helping itself to the top level (maintainer ruling). Still namespaced
-- by the folder name, so it cannot collide with an icon a reader drops in, and
-- still outside plugins/, so a plugin update never touches it.
--
-- Conventions the SVG follows (also in the template): the bottom of the
-- viewBox is the plank surface the ornament stands on; a comment
-- "bookshelf:overhang=N" declares that the lowest N viewBox units hang below
-- the surface, over the plank's front (a paw, a trailing vine). Rendering is
-- KOReader's own RenderImage (nanosvg), so: bold solid shapes, no text, no
-- filters, no masks. Night mode pre-inverts the bitmap, alpha kept.
--
-- A PNG has none of those channels, so it gets the defaults: aspect from the
-- IHDR chunk, overhang always 0, and the night flag from the filename
-- (cat.invert.png). See parsePngHeader. Nothing else about the pipeline
-- differs -- same pick(), same cache, same widget -- because the only thing
-- that actually varies is how an entry is measured and which RenderImage call
-- draws it.
--
-- Placement is deterministic per page composition (seeded by the row's first
-- book and its index range), so an ornament stays put while a page is looked
-- at and changes across pages; about half the eligible gaps stay empty.

M.MIN_H_FRAC    = 0.45   -- ...nor one shrunk (to fit a narrow gap) below this share
                         -- of the books' height: ornaments scale with the shelf,
                         -- a speck beside tall books looked wrong (user report)
M.HEIGHT_FRAC   = 0.8    -- height as a fraction of the books' stand height
-- THE ROW END, where width is the scarce thing and height is not.
--
-- The slot used to be a stand-height SQUARE. Anything wider than that was
-- shrunk to fit and, once the shrinking took it under MIN_H_FRAC, dropped --
-- so a broad ornament simply never appeared, and nothing on screen said why
-- (maintainer: "users will wonder why their ornament never appears if it's
-- just over some hidden limit"). The square is not a rule anybody chose; it
-- is just what falls out of using the height for the width too.
--
-- There is no ceiling here worth the name. An ornament that spans the shelf
-- is a decoration somebody drew that way, and the row it stands on carries no
-- books rather than squeezing one in beside it: "I have no issue with a png
-- taking a full shelf, we don't always need to have a book" (maintainer).
--
-- What the row does hold back is one book's width, measured on the widest
-- thing a row can hold -- a face-out cover. Without it a row is FORCED to
-- seat a book (SpineLayout.fillRows seats at least one), and with only a
-- sliver left that book gets painted past the end of the plank, which is what
-- the device showed. The slot itself is worked out in bookshelf_spine_shelf.
-- A section break stays an aside: it widens a gap BETWEEN two books, in the
-- middle of a row, where a big piece reads as a hole rather than as an end
-- piece. A quarter of the row is as much as that is allowed to take.
M.ASIDE_SHARE   = 0.25
-- ...and a piece that spreads across a row-end slot may stand shorter than
-- one wedged into a gap between books. There is nothing above a row end to
-- crowd, so a low wide piece reads as an ornament rather than as a mistake,
-- where the same piece squeezed between two spines would not.

-- ── Frequency ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- A MULTIPLIER on the odds above, not a replacement for them. The two base
-- chances are deliberately far apart -- a grouping chip's section breaks are
-- far more numerous than the gaps on a plain shelf, so identical odds would
-- put a plant between every other series -- and that relationship should hold
-- at every setting. Scaling both keeps it.
-- The PER-SHELF key: a chip carries its own number in its tab record. There
-- is deliberately no library-wide setting behind it. A default that every
-- shelf can override is a trap -- change the default later and nothing
-- happens, because by then every shelf has a value of its own (maintainer).
-- A shelf that has never been touched holds nothing and gets FREQ_DEFAULT.

M.FREQ_RESERVE_AT = 1.5
-- The odds a RESERVED row end (see SpineShelf.plan) actually takes a piece,
-- before pick() scales them by the level: Often (2) keeps about half its
-- row ends, Lots (3) about five in six. Maintainer: "allow some rows even on
-- 'lots' setting to be occasionally filled with books". A row that rolls
-- nothing gives nothing up, so the odd bookless row costs no shelf.
M.ROW_END_CHANCE = 0.28

-- Odds that survive pick()'s scaling by the level, for the one placement that
-- is a promise rather than a roll. A plain 1 would not do: pick multiplies by
-- the frequency, so at Rarely a "certainty" of 1 comes back out as 0.5.
M.CHANCE_CERTAIN = math.huge

-- ── The group channel has its own curve ───────────────────────────────────
--
-- One level scales every channel, but the channels do not offer the same
-- NUMBER of chances. A plain shelf offers a couple of row ends per page; a
-- grouping chip can offer thirty section breaks. Multiplying both by the same
-- number gives the two complaints that arrived one after the other: nothing
-- at all on a packed plain shelf, and "set ornaments to rarely appear and I
-- have 4 on screen right now" on a chip full of small groups.
--
-- So the section-break channel is damped at the lower levels rather than
-- following the level directly. Per gap, and across a page holding thirty of
-- them:
--
--     level        per gap    expected on such a page
--     Rarely        1.6%              0.5
--     Often         5.6%              1.7
--     Always       16.0%              4.8
--
-- Not a per-screen CAP, which is what this wanted to be: the section-break
-- placement widens the gap it stands in, so it changes how many books fit,
-- and a cap counted per screen would give plan()'s two callers different
-- answers and break page boundaries again (see pageGuaranteed). A curve is a
-- pure function of the level, so both passes still agree.
M.GROUP_LEVEL = { [0] = 0, [0.5] = 0, [1] = 0.7, [2] = 2 }

-- The row end gets a curve too, and for the same reason: it is the channel
-- that was actually doing the work on a grouped chip (instrumented: six
-- placements at 0.28 against one section break at 0.08), so damping the
-- section breaks alone left Rarely at "9 ornaments across 11 pages... often 2
-- on a page", which is not rare.
--
-- ZERO at Rarely. That setting is then exactly its promise -- one page in
-- four stands a piece, and no other channel adds to it -- which is both rare
-- and predictable. Everything above it keeps a roll on top of the promise.
M.ROW_END_LEVEL = { [0] = 0, [0.5] = 0, [1] = 0.7, [2] = 2 }

local function levelFrom(curve)
    local f = M.frequency()

-- ── A ceiling for the channels that can have one ──────────────────────────
--
-- The curve above thins the section breaks, but the other channels keep
-- adding: the promised row end, the odd row end that rolls one anyway, the
-- leftover slack beside a short row. Measured on a grouped chip at Rarely
-- that came to about two a page, which is not what "rarely" promises.
--
-- So the channels that do NOT affect packing take a hard per-screen ceiling,
-- counting everything already standing (a section-break piece is placed
-- earlier, in plan, and counts against it). Only those channels: the
-- section-break piece widens the gap it stands in, so capping it would give
-- plan()'s two callers different answers and break page boundaries -- the
-- constraint that also ruled out a cap for the group channel.

-- ── The per-PAGE promise ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Every other placement is opportunistic: a piece appears where a gap happens
-- to be wide enough. On a plain shelf that can mean almost never. A shelf with
-- no groups has no section breaks at all -- the default Home shelf, flattened
-- folders, is exactly that -- and a densely packed row leaves a few dozen
-- pixels at its end, under MIN_GAP_DP. Both channels empty, at every level
-- below the top one: "set to often, there was only one ornament in total on
-- the whole shelf" (maintainer).
--
-- So a level also says how often a PAGE is promised a piece, and a promised
-- page stands one at a row end whether or not a gap turned up. One page in N:
M.PAGE_PERIOD = { [0] = 0, [0.5] = 4, [1] = 2, [2] = 1 }

        if d < dist then best, dist = period, d end
    end
    return best
end

-- pageGuaranteed(page) -> is THIS page promised a piece?
--
-- Hashed from the page's ORDINAL, not from its books. The ordinal is the one
-- thing both of plan()'s callers agree on: the render knows it, and the
-- pagination pass derives it from the row index. Seeding on anything else --
-- the page's first book, say -- gives the two passes different answers, and
-- they then pack differently and disagree about where pages start.

<!--
  Bookshelf ornaments.

  Drop SVG or PNG files in this folder and they turn up now and then in the
  gaps on the spine shelf, standing on the plank like the books. This file is
  one: a potted plant (cactus.svg beside it is another). Copy it under a new
  name as a starting point, or delete either if you'd rather not see it;
  they won't come back. These two files are Bookshelf's own: when a release
  improves them they are rewritten in place, so an edit to one of them under
  its own name will not survive that.

  A PNG is the quick way in: any picture with a transparent background will
  do, and it stands on the plank at whatever shape it already is. It cannot
  hang over the front of the plank the way the drawing below can, and it is
  scaled to the shelf's height, so start from something reasonably large or
  it will look soft. To have a PNG shown light on a grey screen in night
  mode, put .invert before the extension: cat.invert.png.

  The rest of this file is about SVGs, which can do more.

  The rules of the shelf:

  - The BOTTOM of the viewBox is the plank's front edge. The books stand a
    little way back from it, so the two pieces here leave the last six
    units empty: that space is what sets them back onto the plank beside
    the books rather than on its lip. Leave nothing else floating below
    your last shape.
  - To hang over the front of the plank (a tail, a paw, a trailing vine),
    set the overhang line below to the number of viewBox units that should
    hang below the surface, and draw that part at the bottom.
  - The shelf is seen from slightly above (about 12 degrees), so anything
    with a top (a pot, a box, a cup) shows its opening as a shallow
    ellipse about a fifth as tall as it is wide. Match that and it belongs.
  - Use colour. Colour screens show it as drawn; grey e-ink shows it as
    shades of grey, so keep the tones fairly dark and distinct from each
    other, or it turns to mush. Bold, solid shapes read best. No text, no
    filters, no masks: the renderer is small and they will not show.
    Transparent background, so the shelf shows through.
  - An .svg has to be a DRAWING, not a picture. Converters asked to turn a
    photo into an SVG usually just wrap the photo inside it, and the
    renderer draws no pictures, so the file looks right and comes out
    blank. If you started from a picture, save it as a .png and drop that
    in instead: there is nothing to convert.
  - Height follows the shelf; width follows your aspect ratio. Aim for
    something about as tall as a book and no wider than two or three.
  - Night mode: colour screens always show your colours as drawn, and so
    does a grey e-ink screen here: the shelf turns black and these two
    pieces keep their tones, which still read against it. A plain dark
    silhouette would sink into that black, so for one of those add a line
    above the svg tag in the form of the overhang line, with night=invert
    in place of overhang=0: it is then shown light, like the spine titles.
