-- main.lua
-- Plugin entry point. Registers start_with=bookshelf, hooks close-document,
-- and takes over the home screen on launch when configured to do so.
--
-- KOReader API notes (verified against KOReader source):
--
--   * FileManagerMenu.menu_items is an *instance* attribute built lazily in
--     setUpdateItemTable(), which is called the first time the menu opens.
--     The class table itself has no menu_items — so we cannot patch it via
--     FMMenu.menu_items at init time.
--
--   * The start_with sub_item_table is constructed inside
--     FileManagerMenu:getStartWithMenuTable() and assigned to
--     self.menu_items.start_with only *after* addToMainMenu callbacks have
--     already fired (addToMainMenu runs at line ~458, start_with is set at
--     line ~491 in filemanagermenu.lua).
--
--   * Therefore we monkey-patch FileManagerMenu.getStartWithMenuTable at the
--     *class* level so that every instance builds the table with our entry
--     already included. The patch is idempotent (duplicate-guard on "bookshelf").
--
--   * onCloseDocument is dispatched via ReaderUI:handleEvent(Event:new(
--     "CloseDocument")) which propagates to all registered child widgets
--     (plugins are inserted via registerModule → table.insert(self, ...)). So
--     defining Bookshelf:onCloseDocument() is sufficient — no manual subscribe
--     needed.
--
--   * is_doc_only = false — plugin loads in both FileManager and Reader contexts,
--     which is required so the close-document hook fires inside the Reader.

-- navigated to, follow the navigation: drill the bookshelf into that folder so

--

-- invalidates the device-state cache and asks for a repaint. None of it ran
-- here, because there is no BookshelfWidget in the reader - the strip calls
-- BookshelfWidget.deviceState() as a plain function. The plugin IS a ReaderUI
-- module and does receive these events, so the handlers belong here.
--

-- 5s device-state cache and paint the value we were trying to replace;
-- invalidating alone would leave nothing to trigger the paint.

-- Some home-replacement plugins react to system broadcasts
-- (NetworkConnected, NetworkDisconnected, Resume, LeaveStandby,
-- ReaderUI close → FM re-init, etc.) by closing and re-showing their
-- own homescreen widget. The re-show pushes onto the TOP of the
-- UIManager stack, BURYING bookshelf underneath. The intruder
-- widget is covers_fullscreen, so it intercepts all input and
-- bookshelf becomes unreachable until the user manually toggles it
-- off and on again from the menu. (SimpleUI's _refreshCurrentView
-- -> _navigate("home", ...) flow is the observed-in-the-wild case;
-- the same pattern can come from any plugin that competes for the
-- home-screen slot.)
--
-- When start_with == "bookshelf", any covers_fullscreen widget above
-- us is unwanted -- bookshelf IS the home, and the intruder is
-- dormant placeholder state that doesn't belong on top. Modals
-- (InfoMessage, ConfirmBox, InputDialog, KOReader's TouchMenu, etc.)
-- don't set covers_fullscreen, so they're naturally excluded by the
-- flag check; we only catch widgets that structurally claim to be a
-- home-screen replacement.
--
-- nextTick deferral is required: the offending plugin's handler and
-- ours often fire in the same broadcastEvent dispatch in non-
-- deterministic order. Running inline can hit the stack BEFORE the
-- intruder has been pushed, finding nothing to close. Deferring
-- past the current dispatch guarantees we see the post-cascade
-- state.
--
-- Closing the offending widget is sufficient -- UIManager:close
-- marks its (fullscreen) dimen dirty automatically and uses a nil
-- refresh type (uimanager.lua:1119) so no explicit refresh is
-- enqueued. The natural repaint pass renders bookshelf in its
-- place via incremental refresh. No setDirty / forceRePaint needed
-- (and "full" would cause an unnecessary flash).
--
-- Call sites: network events (onNetworkConnected /
-- onNetworkDisconnected), wake events (folded into
-- _repaintAfterWake which fires on onResume / onLeaveStandby), and
-- the tail of Bookshelf:show() (so every reader-return,
-- toggle-on, and takeover flow gets defense for free). The walk is
-- a cheap no-op when nothing's on top, so the redundancy across
-- multiple trigger paths costs essentially nothing.
--
-- Complements the existing homescreen-overlay cleanup in
-- bookshelf_toggle (main.lua:466-479): that path walks the whole

-- (status / rating / tags / series / authors / cover / etc) from any entry
-- point: the long-press menu on a shelf cover, FileManager's book-info
-- screen, the History panel, the reader's book-info screen. Any of those
-- can shift a book's membership in a status- or filter-driven chip, or
-- reorder it within a sort that depends on the changed field.
--
-- Without this handler, bookshelf's per-chip result caches stay stale --
-- the user has to swipe-down or restart to see the change (issue #40).
-- The prop_updated arg is sometimes nil (broadcast-everything cases),
-- sometimes a single field name, and on some KOReader versions / async paths
-- a table of changed props; we treat every change as potentially
-- membership-affecting since chips can sort or filter on any field.
--
-- Coalescing: a single user action can fire BookMetadataChanged twice
-- (e.g. filemanagerbookinfo close_callback emits one event with the
-- specific prop_updated and a second with nil for the summary-folder
-- side-effect). Cache invalidation is cheap and runs every time; the
-- rebuild is deferred to nextTick and gated by a pending flag so we
-- repaint at most once per user action.
--
-- Hidden-bookshelf case: when bookshelf isn't visible (reader on top, or
-- editing from History over FileManager), invalidating the cache alone
-- isn't enough -- softRefresh's _needsReaderReturnShelfRefresh gate is
-- keyed on chip+sort and doesn't know about metadata edits, so a status
-- change that should re-shuffle membership would be skipped. The flag on
-- the widget forces softRefresh down the heavy path on next return.
