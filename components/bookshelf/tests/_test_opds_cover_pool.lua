-- tests/_test_opds_cover_pool.lua
-- _opdsCoverPool: the forked worker pool that fetches OPDS covers and child
-- feeds off the UI thread. This is the path that actually runs on device
-- (_opdsCoverStep is the fallback for platforms that cannot fork), and it was
-- the untested one.
--
-- What it has to keep doing:
--   * never more than the concurrency cap in flight
--   * cached covers cost no worker at all
--   * a resolved one-book folder's cover joins the queue STILL RUNNING, so a
--     catalog made entirely of folder tiles starts filling seconds in rather
--     than after the last resolve
--   * a superseded page kills its workers instead of finishing into a shelf
--     nobody is looking at
--   * a broken fork falls back to the sequential chain rather than dropping
--     the work
--
-- Extracted by name and run against stubs, like the step chain's suite: the
-- real method needs ffi, UIManager and the widget tree.
