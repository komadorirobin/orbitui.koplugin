-- sections, one per directory that actually holds books.
--
-- The spine shelf flattens any item carrying `books` into a badged run, so
-- the Home-folders source only has to hand it the right grouping. The rules
-- that are easy to get wrong and impossible to see on a screenshot live
-- here: tree order, and the wrapper-folder fold that stops a Calibre
-- library (Author/Title/book.epub) becoming one section per book.
