-- tests/_test_new_tokens.lua
-- The tokens added for issues 298 and 333: SSH status, and the page and
-- chapter of the quote %quote picked.
--
-- Usage (from plugin root): lua tests/_test_new_tokens.lua
--
-- All five are pure catalogue-plus-expander additions with no UI of their own,
-- so what needs pinning is not layout but three quieter contracts:
--
--   * every catalogue entry has a working expander behind it. A token that
--     lists in the picker and renders as its own literal text is worse than an
--     absent one -- the reader inserts it, sees "%quote_page" on their shelf,
--     and files a bug.
--   * %quote_page and %quote_chapter describe the SAME highlight %quote chose.
--     Quotes.forBook re-rolls a random pick per key, so three tokens each
--     calling it independently would attribute one quote to another's page.
