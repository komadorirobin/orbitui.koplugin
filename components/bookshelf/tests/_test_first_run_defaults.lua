-- tests/_test_first_run_defaults.lua
-- What a brand new install looks like before anyone touches a setting.
--
-- WHY THIS IS PINNED. Every value here is an ordinary setting the reader can
-- change, which is exactly why they drift: each one looks harmless on its own
-- and nothing else in the suite would notice. Together they are the first
-- impression, and they were chosen deliberately -- they are the maintainer's
-- own shelf settings, adopted so that a first launch shows what the plugin is
-- for rather than what it could do on day one.
--
-- Change any of them on purpose and update this file in the same commit. The
-- test exists to make that a decision rather than an accident.
--
-- Usage (from plugin root): lua tests/_test_first_run_defaults.lua
