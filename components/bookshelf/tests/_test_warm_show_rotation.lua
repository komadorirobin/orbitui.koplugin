-- The shelf comes back the way round the reader left the screen.
--
-- THE REPORT (#435, from the author of quickmenu.koplugin, who names the
-- commit). "Since v5.1.2 (and probably commit 694ad71) ... if i launch a book
-- and change the orientation and then close the book with my exit tab:
-- filemanager (during its brief apparition) follow the new orientation (i use
-- keep orientation between view) but [bookshelf does not]."
--
-- WHY IT ONLY STARTED THEN. show()'s warm branch restores the rotation the
-- shelf had before the book was opened. That branch used to be reached by the
-- hot-park finish and _safeShow only; the ORDINARY close cold-created a
-- replacement shelf, which was built at whatever rotation the screen was in
-- and so followed it. 694ad71 stopped the ordinary close throwing the shelf
-- away -- which is the whole point of it, the close went from 705ms to 90ms
-- on a PW5 -- and every close now takes the warm branch, restore included.
--
-- TWO RULES COME OUT OF IT:
--
--   * "Keep current rotation across views" (KOReader's lock_rotation) means
--     what its help says: "nothing will ever sneak a rotation behind your
--     back". With it set, we do not put ours back.
--   * However the screen ends up, a tree measured for the other shape cannot
--     just be repainted. softRefresh swaps content inside the existing
--     layout; a turn needs the rebuild.
--
