-- Device baselines. Every number here is MEASURED, not invented: each comes
-- from driving KOReader offscreen at that geometry (SDL_VIDEODRIVER=offscreen
-- with EMULATE_READER_W/H/DPI) and reading back what the plugin actually
-- computed. The earlier fabricated `scale = 1.8 / 2.0` figures could not be
-- checked against anything, and a row-count test whose inputs are invented can
-- only ever prove its own arithmetic -- which is how a list view that showed
-- FEWER books than the cover grid passed this file.
--
--   w, h, dpi   the geometry the sweep ran. `dpi` is the screen_dpi override
--               in force; nil means NO override (see scaleBySize below).
--   font_h      rendered height of ListRow's face -- infofont, the CHIP BAR's
--               face, at the chip bar's size 16 -- measured there, at
--               list_font_scale = 100
--   PAD         _layoutPrimitives' PAD, the cover grid's inter-shelf gap
--   avail       the vertical budget _maxRows(list) hands the expanded shelf
--               block (logged as "[bookshelf perf] _maxRows(list) ... avail=")
--   grid_books  what the COVER grid shows expanded at the same geometry:
--               _nShelves() * _nCols(). This is the number list mode has to
--               beat to justify existing.
--   rows        what list mode ACTUALLY shows expanded, read back from the
--               same sweep. One number, not two: the row height no longer
--               depends on whether the Cover column is on.
--   was_rows    what the TEXT-TIGHT density model showed with covers on -- the
--               densest the list has ever been -- kept so the cost of moving
--               to the chip bar's band is stated in the suite rather than only
--               in a report.
--   h150 rows150 the row height and row count MEASURED at list_font_scale = 150
--   h200 rows200 the same at 200. Both from renders at the same geometries
--               with only that key changed (chip_font_scale left at 100), and
--               they are what makes the ceiling arithmetic below a checked
--               model rather than an assumption. chip_h was byte-identical to
--               the scale-100 render at both, on every panel -- the separation
--               of the two keys, measured.

-- here: an earlier revision listed three and said the 600x800 Kindle was
-- "covered separately below", and nothing below covered it -- which mattered,

-- width. So cover_h == content_h in every ordinary row, and the two only
-- diverge once that cap bites -- a listing configured for one or two rows a
-- page, whose description runs to twenty lines, gets a cover a fraction of the
-- row's height.

-- that case the picture floated in the middle of the row with a hand's width of
-- blank paper above it, level with nothing, while the title it belongs to sat
-- at the top. Seen on a PW5, 2026-08-31.

-- contract with KOReader: which container class, and what alignment it asks
-- for. Re-implementing WidgetContainer:paintTo here to measure a y offset would
