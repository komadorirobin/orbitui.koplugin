-- tests/_test_page_count_report.lua
-- Tokens.pageCountReportHtml: the page-count scan's closing report.
--
-- The scan can end three ways and the heading has to tell them apart. Two
-- were already distinct; the third was being reported as the user's doing.
-- Trapper:dismissableRunInSubprocess returns the same "not completed" for a
-- dismissed book and for a fork that never started, and after a long scan on
-- a small device it is the fork that fails -- so a reader who touched nothing
-- was told they had cancelled, and went looking for a stray tap (issue 388).
--
-- Usage (from plugin root): lua tests/_test_page_count_report.lua
