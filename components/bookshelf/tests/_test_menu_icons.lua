-- tests/_test_menu_icons.lua
-- The glyphs in front of menu labels: where they may come from, and that
-- every top-level entry has one.
--
-- WHY THE RANGE IS THE RULE. KOReader bundles nerdfonts/symbols.ttf, which
-- covers the Private Use Area (U+E000..U+F8FF) and is listed as font fallback
-- 6 -- so a plain label renders one of these with no per-item font face. Reach
-- outside that range and two things go wrong: the glyph may not resolve at
-- all, and, far worse, a non-PUA arrow (U+21BB) once segfaulted the
-- start-menu render on a PW5, twice, with no Lua traceback. That broadening
-- was reverted rather than solved and the cause was never pinned, so this test
-- treats the PUA as a hard boundary rather than a preference.
--
-- The glyph also has to stay OUT of the translatable string. A private-use
-- codepoint is invisible in most .po editors and would be lost by the first
-- translator to retype the line.
--
-- Usage (from plugin root): lua tests/_test_menu_icons.lua
