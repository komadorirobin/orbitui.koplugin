-- tests/_test_file_poll_baseline.lua
-- Files that arrive while the device is asleep must still be noticed.
--
-- ── WHAT WENT WRONG ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- The shelf polls its home directory's mtimes every few seconds and calls
-- Repo.invalidateWalkCache() when they move. That invalidation is the ONLY
-- thing that makes a new book appear: the walk and group caches no longer
-- expire by time ("vestigial; HIT paths no longer consult expires_at"), and
-- getSeriesGroups' cache in particular returns its stored shapes without ever
-- re-statting the filesystem.
--
-- onSuspend cancels the poll; onResume re-arms it, saying it does so "so a
-- wake-up detects any files synced while the device was suspended". But
-- _startFilePoll re-snapshotted unconditionally, so the pre-sleep baseline was
-- thrown away and replaced with the post-sync state -- the change was absorbed
-- into the new baseline and never seen. Books synced overnight stayed
-- invisible until something else happened to invalidate: opening and closing a
-- book, a swipe-down refresh, or a restart.
--
-- The covered-by-another-widget branch already avoids exactly this, and says
-- so: "re-arming via _startFilePoll re-baselines, which silently swallows any
-- file that arrived while covered". The same hazard simply was not applied to
-- the sleep path. _cancelFilePoll never cleared the baseline, so the fix is to
-- stop overwriting it.
--
-- Reported from a device: two books synced in and did not appear, with the
-- files present on disk and correctly timestamped.
--
-- Usage (from plugin root): lua tests/_test_file_poll_baseline.lua
