-- tests/_test_shelves_menu.lua
-- The shelves menu leads with editing, and says how to hide.
--
-- WHAT NEEDS PINNING. "Bookshelf shelves" named the noun, not the job, and a
-- tap toggled a shelf on or off while EDITING one was hidden behind a
-- long-press that nothing advertised except a line above the list. Editing is
-- the thing people come here for, so the tap now opens the editor and the
-- long-press does the showing and hiding, with the hint moved to the bottom
-- where a reader lands after reading the shelves rather than before
-- (maintainer: "basically the opposite to how it is now").
--
-- The hint must still be a disabled ROW rather than help_text: help_text
-- costs a tap to read, and the whole problem is a reader who does not know
-- there is anything to look for.
--
-- Usage (from plugin root): lua tests/_test_shelves_menu.lua
