-- tests/_test_ornament_page_cadence.lua
-- Ornaments are promised per PAGE, and both planners agree which page.
--
-- THE REPORT. "Set to often, there was only one ornament in total on the whole
-- shelf." Every placement was opportunistic -- a piece appeared where a gap
-- happened to be wide enough -- and on a plain shelf that can mean almost
-- never: a shelf with no groups has no section breaks at all, and a densely
-- packed row leaves a few dozen pixels at its end, under the minimum gap.
--
-- THE TRAP THAT SANK THE FIRST ATTEMPT. plan() has two callers. The render
-- plans ONE page. _spinePageFirsts plans the WHOLE library in one call and
-- cuts the rows into pages, and that is where page boundaries come from.
-- Anything decided in plan() changes how many books fit on a row, so the two
-- must decide identically or they disagree about where pages start. The first
-- attempt seeded the promise on the plan's first book -- the chip's first book
-- in one pass, the page's first book in the other -- and page numbers came out
-- twice. It was reverted.
--
-- So the seed is the page's ORDINAL and the row's position WITHIN that page,
-- which both passes can state: the render knows them, and the pagination pass
-- derives them from rows_per_page.
