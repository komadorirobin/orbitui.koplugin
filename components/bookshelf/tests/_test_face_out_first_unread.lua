-- tests/_test_face_out_first_unread.lua
-- "First unread in series": the NEXT one to read stands cover-forward.
--
-- THE REQUEST. "Please add an option for spines to show cover only the first
-- unread book in the series. Basically the next unread in the series." Once a
-- series is part-read, its first book is the least interesting cover on the
-- shelf -- the reader has finished it -- and the one worth showing is the one
-- they have not got to.
--
-- WHY IT IS DECIDED IN THE PLAN LOOP, not in _flattenItems where its sibling
-- `first_of_group` is set: "unread" is a question about STATUS, and status is
-- only resolved as the loop reaches each entry (light page records carry
-- none, so the sidecar is read there). The loop walks the flattened list in
-- order, so the first member of a run that comes up unread is the earliest
-- unread one.
--
