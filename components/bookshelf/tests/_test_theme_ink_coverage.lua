-- Every piece of shelf chrome has to say what colour its ink is.
--
-- WHAT NEEDS PINNING, and why it is a whole test file rather than a fix.
--
-- KOReader's TextWidget defaults to BLACK and FrameContainer's border defaults
-- to BLACK. In device night mode that is correct and invisible: the frame
-- inversion turns black into white for free, which is why none of this was
-- ever needed. Under the shelf's OWN dark theme on a light device nothing
-- inverts, so every widget that stayed silent about its colour paints black
-- on a black panel and disappears.
--
-- That has now been found by hand four separate times -- the footer icons,
-- the footer page label, the chip strip's outline, and the hero's title,
-- stars, review count and description. Each time it was one omission among
-- neighbours that did it correctly, which is exactly the kind of thing a
-- reviewer's eye slides over. So this walks the constructors instead.

-- Usage (from plugin root): lua tests/_test_theme_ink_coverage.lua
