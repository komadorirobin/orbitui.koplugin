-- tests/_test_series_author_sort.lua
-- Sorting a shelf of GROUPS by author uses the members' author, not the
-- group's display name (issue #351).
--
-- Run from the plugin root: `lua tests/_test_series_author_sort.lua`
--
-- THE BUG. A series stack is { series_name = "The Expanse", books = {...} }:
-- it carries its members but no author of its own. The fallback chain in
-- cachedSurname reached b.series_name and handed the SERIES TITLE to
-- surnameSortKey, which parsed the last word of the title as a person's
-- surname. So "sort by author surname" on a series shelf ordered by the last
-- word of each series name -- "The Expanse" filed under E, "Discworld" under
-- D -- which looks alphabetical enough to miss, and is not the requested
-- ordering at all.
--
-- The nasty part is that it never errors and never looks obviously wrong: a
-- list sorted by the wrong string is still a sorted list.
