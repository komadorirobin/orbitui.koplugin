-- tests/_test_token_picker_shell.lua
-- SOURCE-SHAPE checks for which LibraryModal the token picker opens.
--
-- bookshelf_settings.lua is 5k lines and needs the full widget stack to load,
-- so these read the source -- named as such, per the repo's convention.
-- Comment lines are stripped first so prose quoting the patterns cannot
-- satisfy a check.
--
-- WHAT WENT WRONG. _pickToken used to require("menu.library_modal") -- the
-- copy that ships with the SISTER PLUGIN, bookends -- because bookshelf had
-- no shell of its own when it was written. It has one now, and every other
-- picker uses it. That one straggler meant the token picker's chrome depended
-- on whether a second plugin happened to be installed, and the two copies had
-- since diverged: ours grew swipe-to-page and grid dpad nav, bookends's did
-- not. Result on a machine with both installed: swipe paging worked in the
-- icon picker and silently did nothing in the token picker.
--
-- The last test is the one that earns its keep. It does not check a fixed
-- list of features; it reads the config keys the picker actually hands the
-- shell and insists our shell consumes each one, so the next key added to the
-- picker is checked too.
