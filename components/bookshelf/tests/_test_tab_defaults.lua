-- tests/_test_tab_defaults.lua
-- What a fresh install ships as shelves, and what it does not.
--
-- TWO THINGS THE MAINTAINER ASKED FOR, both from their own device after a
-- "reset to defaults" did not produce the arrangement they meant:
--
--   * Recent opens as a LIST and Genres uses the RIBBON style. Those were
--     the intended defaults and had never been captured in code.
--   * A fresh install ships ONLY the shelves that are on. It used to ship
--     all nine with five switched off, which fills the shelf editor with
--     rows nobody asked for and pushes the help line and "+ Add new shelf"
--     off the bottom -- so the two things a new reader needs to see are the
--     two they cannot.
--
-- THE TRAP THIS GUARDS. DEFAULTS() has three consumers, and one of them is
-- migrate(), which rebuilds a v1 reader's tab list. v1 shipped every chip
-- ENABLED, so rebuilding from the trimmed set would silently delete five
-- shelves they were using. migrate() therefore reads BUILTINS() and only the
-- fresh-install path reads DEFAULTS().
--
