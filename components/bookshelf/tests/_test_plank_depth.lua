-- tests/_test_plank_depth.lua
-- The shelf plank's three numbers, and the one relationship that must hold.
--
-- WHAT NEEDS PINNING.
--
-- 1. THE SHELF IS AS DEEP AS THE BOOKS. The plank's top face and a spine's
--    page block are both horizontal surfaces under the same 12-degree camera,
--    so the eye compares them directly. The plank painted 24px under books
--    showing 43px, which does not read as a shallow shelf -- it reads as an
--    impossible one (maintainer). The board now asks SpineLayout for the same
--    depth the tallest book shows, so the two cannot drift apart again.
--
-- 2. THREE NUMBERS, NOT TWO. Inset (what shows in front of the feet), surface
--    (the painted board) and lift (how far a held book rises) used to be two
--    literals, with surface and lift sharing one value by accident. Deepening
--    the board would have doubled the lift. They are separate now, and the
--    test that matters is that changing the depth does NOT move the lift.
--
-- 3. ONE DEFINITION EACH. `3 * b` appeared in five places and
--    `math.floor(b * 0.8)` in three. Each site looked locally correct, so
--    nothing caught a change to one copy.
