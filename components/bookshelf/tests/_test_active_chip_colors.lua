-- tests/_test_active_chip_colors.lua
-- The currently-reading button looks the same drilled in as it does at the top.
--
-- WHAT NEEDS PINNING. A selected chip normally renders by INVERTING its own
-- rect. On a manually dark shelf there is nothing to invert -- the fill is
-- cleared under a wallpaper -- so the chips layout asks for an explicit pair
-- instead: the bar's own colour as ink on the theme's ink as fill.
--
-- The breadcrumb layout asked only for the READER's custom chip colours, and
-- had no theme fallback beneath it. With none set, on a dark shelf, the
-- currently-reading button and its roof pointer fell back to inverting: a
-- black cell with a white glyph, where the same button one level up is a white
-- cell with a dark glyph. Reported from a drilled-in shelf (Genres > Time
-- Travel) on a PW5.
--
-- One helper answers for both layouts now, so they cannot drift again.
--
-- Usage (from plugin root): lua tests/_test_active_chip_colors.lua
