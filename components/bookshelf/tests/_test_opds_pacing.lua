-- tests/_test_opds_pacing.lua
-- The cover pool SLOWS DOWN for a refusing catalog; it never stops.
--
-- WHY THIS SHAPE (issue 434, third attempt and the one that stuck).
-- KOReader's own OPDS browser makes one request per user action -- its list
-- is text, thumbnail urls are parsed but never downloaded for it -- so it
-- cannot trip a rate limit and has nothing here to copy. Every request in
-- our burst is ours: a cover grid is twenty images a page, fired eight at a
-- time, and a server capped at three refuses most of them.
--
-- The first two attempts abandoned the run and scheduled a retry. Measured on
-- device both times, the covers on the page in front of the reader simply
-- stopped:
--
--     "still only loads a few covers per page then stops"
--     "after a restart, I now only get 2 covers before it appears to stall"
--
-- and the server log showed why -- 3 x 200 then 7 x 429, then silence. The
-- abandon also wedged the poll: fill() stopped advancing next_i, so
-- `next_i < #queue` stayed true forever and the completion tail holding the
-- retry was never reached.
--
-- Slowing down has none of that. The queue keeps draining, so covers keep
-- arriving; a capped server sees roughly the serial traffic stock would have
-- sent; and the retry, the token dance and the re-arm all go away.
