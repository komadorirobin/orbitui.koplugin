-- tests/_test_safe_show_takeover.lua
-- main.lua: Bookshelf:_safeShow must announce the onShow takeover.
--
-- #385 (the #110 flash class, back again). _safeShow is the reader -> "File
-- browser" route: close the document, show KOReader's FileManager, then raise
-- the shelf over it. showFileManager fires a Show event, and Bookshelf:onShow
-- catching that SYNCHRONOUSLY is the only thing that puts the shelf on top
-- before anything can paint the bare FileManager.
--
-- onShow's gate is positive -- it stands down unless a takeover was announced
-- (commit e39d639, so another home-screen plugin's Show is not hijacked) --
-- and on this route nobody was announcing it:
--   * onCloseDocument returns early on _suppress_close_document_show, which
--     _safeShow sets, and the announce sits BELOW that return;
--   * the FileManager's own init only announces on the session's FIRST
--     FileManager (_did_initial_takeover), never on a reader-close one.
-- So the FM sat alone on the window stack until the raise two statements
-- later. Rig-verified both ways: without the announce the stack after
-- showFileManager is [filemanager], with it [filemanager | bookshelf].
--
-- Usage (from plugin root): lua tests/_test_safe_show_takeover.lua
