-- tests/_test_onshow_takeover.lua
-- main.lua: Bookshelf:onShow, the synchronous catch that puts the shelf on
-- top of KOReader's file manager before anything can paint it.
--
-- Issue 385. The reporter's own diagnostic trace settled it:
--
--     route: document closing
--     instant book close: true | start with: history
--        0ms onCloseDocument.enter | bookshelf > ReaderUI
--      645ms forceRePaint         | fullscreen
--
-- Their "Start with" is History, and onShow returned on its first line
-- because of it -- so the takeover never ran, the file manager stood alone,
-- and the repaint at 645ms is the flash. The shelf arrived later, on
-- onCloseDocument's next tick.
--
-- Where the shelf goes when a book CLOSES was decoupled from "Start with"
-- deliberately (issue #98): the reader-close destination is "whatever opened
-- the book", not a restart preference. onShow never got that memo. It does
-- not need the check either way now -- the announcement IS the gate, and only
-- a route that means to take this Show sets it. Cold boot still announces
-- only when Start with is Bookshelf.
--
-- Usage (from plugin root): lua tests/_test_onshow_takeover.lua
