-- tests/_test_night_mode_repaint.lua
-- The night-mode toggle repaints the shelf ONCE, not in three instalments.
--
-- WHAT NEEDS PINNING. KOReader's DeviceListener flips the screen, queues a
-- full refresh and saves night_mode -- AFTER our handler, because the shelf
-- sits above the file manager in the window stack and a broadcast walks it
-- top down. So the shelf has to defer. It used to defer twice: recolour the
-- glyphs and folder cards on the next tick and paint, then rebuild on the
-- tick after that and paint again, plus a debounced status-strip repaint.
-- With KOReader's own refresh that is three or four visible changes for one
-- toggle (maintainer: "looks a bit of a mess"). The recolour pass dates from
-- when a rebuild took half a second; the rebuild is what fixes everything, so
-- it runs on the first deferred tick and nothing else paints.
--
-- Usage (from plugin root): lua tests/_test_night_mode_repaint.lua
