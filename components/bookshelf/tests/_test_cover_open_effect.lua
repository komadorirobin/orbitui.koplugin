-- tests/_test_cover_open_effect.lua
-- BookshelfWidget:_paintOpeningEffect draws the tapped cover's chrome ITSELF,
-- with its own arc scan and its own rounded-shadow repaint, rather than going
-- back through SpineWidget. That is deliberate (it is patching pixels already
-- on screen, mid-frame, with no widget to re-render), but it means the flat
-- cover options have to be honoured a second time, here, or opening a book
-- flashes back the rounded corners and drop shadow the reader turned off.
--
-- SOURCE-SHAPE checks, like tests/_test_list_row_budget.lua's: the function
-- paints into a live Screen.bb and cannot be driven under stubs, and there is
-- exactly one call site. Delete either guard and every other suite stays green
-- while the bug comes back.
