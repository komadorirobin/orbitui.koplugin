-- tests/_test_custom_metadata_probe.lua
-- _customPropsFor asks for a book's custom_metadata.lua once per book during
-- the light-meta build. (It was _customKeywords until the whole custom_props
-- table started being read rather than just the keywords -- issue #381 -- but
-- the probe it performs, and everything below, is unchanged.) The sibling
-- ".sdr" fast path answers that with one stat against a path the cached
-- directory listing already proved exists,
-- instead of DocSettings:findCustomMetadataFile stat-ing every candidate
-- location. On a PW5 (243 books, 82% with a sidecar, 11 with custom metadata)
-- that took the probe from ~190ms to ~130ms of a ~1000ms cold build.
--
-- The fast path is only SOUND when the sibling is the only place the file
-- could be. These are SOURCE-SHAPE checks on that condition: the function is
-- a module local several layers below any exported entry point, and the
-- repository suite's fixture does not reach it (verified). The device
-- measurement showed the same 11 files found either way.

-- The gate answers "does this book have a sibling .sdr?" from a per-directory

-- proves the key normalisation below, since a mismatched key makes the whole
