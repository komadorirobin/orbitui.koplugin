-- A book whose metadata arrives after the shelf first painted it must lose
-- its stand-in spine: the file name ("Author - Title", as OPDS names
-- downloads) and the grey default look. The poll's ready branch rebuilt
-- the rows from the spine caches, which still held the stand-in, so the
-- spine kept the author in its title with authors switched off (GitHub
-- issue 477).
