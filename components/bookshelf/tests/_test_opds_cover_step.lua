-- tests/_test_opds_cover_step.lua
-- The stepwise automatic-cover chain: one cover per scheduled tick, abandoned
-- the moment the page it was fetching for stops being the page on screen.
--
-- This exists because the thing it protects is a FEELING -- "paging feels
-- stuck" -- and the mechanism that produces it is invisible from the outside.
-- The previous cover pass downloaded a whole page serially inside one call
-- with nothing yielding, so on Internet Archive (8 seconds a cover, measured)
-- the shelf froze in 20-second blocks and page turns did not register. The
-- guarantees below are what replaced that, and each is one line of code that a
-- later edit could quietly drop:
--
--   * exactly one download per tick, so input is processed between covers
--   * the token re-tested EVERY tick, so paging abandons the chain
--   * liveness re-tested every tick, so a closed shelf stops downloading
--   * cached records skipped WITHIN a tick, so a fully-cached page costs
--     nothing rather than a fifth of a second per cell
--
-- Extracted by name and run against stubs: the real method needs UIManager, a
-- network stack and the widget tree.
