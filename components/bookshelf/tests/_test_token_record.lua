-- Pure-Lua tests for the lazy token adapter.
-- Usage (from plugin root): lua tests/_test_token_record.lua
--
-- The property under test is one sentence: Tokens.expand must work on a
-- WRAPPED SHELF RECORD with no change to lib/bookshelf_tokens.lua. So the
-- expansions below go through the real Tokens module, unstubbed, against the
-- real shelf record shape (helpers.shelf_record), and the controls run the
-- SAME expansion on the SAME record unwrapped -- because a test that only
-- asserts the wrapped case cannot tell a working adapter from a fixture that
-- was carrying the answer all along, which is precisely how the column
-- accessors passed for five rounds while every one of these read empty on the
-- device.
