-- tests/_test_spine_plan_page_count.lua
-- The spine plan's page-count block: what the width uses, and what it leaves
-- behind on the record.
--
-- Run from the plugin root: lua tests/_test_spine_plan_page_count.lua
--
-- WHAT HAPPENED. The block resolves a count so the spine can be drawn at the
-- right width, and it did that correctly -- into a LOCAL. The record's own
-- page_count was assigned in one branch only (the sidecar read), so a count
-- that came from the persisted scan store made the spine wider and reached
-- nothing else: %page_count in the hero stayed empty for exactly the books the
-- scan had just measured. Device report, twice in two days.
--
-- Extracted rather than driven through SpineShelf.plan(): the block is a dozen
-- lines inside a 440-line function that needs a Screen, a font cache and a
-- populated BookInfoManager. Compiling it with an environment makes its
-- upvalues stubbable, which is the only way to say "the store had it and the
-- sidecar did not" precisely.
