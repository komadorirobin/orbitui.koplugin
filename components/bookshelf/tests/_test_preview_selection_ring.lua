-- tests/_test_preview_selection_ring.lua
-- The selection ring must follow the previewed book, even after a hero tap has
-- staged the hero as "tap once more to open" (#335).
--
-- The bug it pins: _selectedFilepath() ranks _tap_selected_fp ABOVE
-- _preview_book. The hero's on_tap latches _tap_selected_fp when
-- tap_to_open_double is on, and no collapsed shelf tap cleared it, so every
-- later preview left the ring pinned to the hero's book.
--
-- Why it only showed in some chips: _previewBook has two repaint paths. The
-- fast one passes is_selected explicitly to _repaintSelectionHighlight, which
-- masks the stale latch. The _rebuild() path derives the ring from
-- _selectedFilepath() instead, and it only runs when the preview crosses the
-- "is this the currently-reading book" boundary (was_diff ~= is_diff) - i.e.
-- only in a chip that CONTAINS the current book, such as a STATUS:Reading chip
-- sorted by Opened, where lastfile is the first tile.
--
-- Both method bodies are extracted by name and run under stubs, as
-- _test_hero_preview_cycle does.
