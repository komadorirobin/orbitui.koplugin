-- tests/_test_ornament_per_shelf.lua
-- Ornament frequency is a per-shelf pin, set where it is relevant.
--
-- WHAT NEEDS PINNING. The control lived in the library settings, two menus
-- away from the only mode it affects, and applied to every shelf at once.
-- It now sits in the shelf style dialog, in the spine-only block, and a chip
-- may pin its own: a crowded shelf on one and a bare one on another
-- (maintainer). An untouched chip stores ABSENCE and shows the word its
-- default resolves to; there is no "Default" stop, because on a dial this
-- short a value the reader cannot see is a trap.
--
-- The stops also have to LOOK different from each other. pick() multiplies
-- the base odds by the level and skips the roll once the product reaches 1,
-- so two stops that both saturate are the same picture on a plain shelf.
-- That shipped: Often (2) and Lots (3) were indistinguishable.
--
-- The module reads the value at PLAN time, so the widget has to push it
-- before it builds anything, next to the other build-time flags.
--
-- Usage (from plugin root): lua tests/_test_ornament_per_shelf.lua
