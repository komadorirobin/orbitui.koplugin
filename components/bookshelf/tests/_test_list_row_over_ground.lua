-- tests/_test_list_row_over_ground.lua
-- Over a painted ground, a list row paints no card of its own.
--
-- WHAT NEEDS PINNING. The shelf already draws a scrim panel behind its
-- content when a wallpaper or a background colour is showing, and the listing
-- sits on that. Each row was ALSO painting its own plate, so on device the
-- picture survived only in the gutters between rows (maintainer, with a
-- screenshot: "listing rows already sit on the scrim panel, they don't need
-- an extra background panel for each row").
--
-- Two surfaces fill paper, and both have to stop. The card's FrameContainer
-- is the obvious one. The other is every wrapping paragraph: TextBoxWidget
-- fills its own background whatever the frame does, which is why the row goes
-- through TransparentTextBox over a ground instead - the hero column's
-- solution, one ink composited as an alpha mask. The single-line TextWidget
-- needs nothing: it paints glyphs only.
--
-- ROW_BG is NOT cleared. It stays the notional paper that the muted-ink blend
-- and the focus ring reason about; the flag only decides whether it is filled
-- in. And the row's outer size must not move: dropping the border that
-- reserves the focus ring has to give that space back as padding, or every
-- row in the band changes height.
