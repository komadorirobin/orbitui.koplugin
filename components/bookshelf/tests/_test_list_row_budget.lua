-- The WIDGET side of the list density model: BookshelfWidget:_listRowHeight()
-- and :_listRowGap(), driven against their real method bodies.
--
-- tests/_test_list_geom.lua proves the arithmetic in bookshelf_list_geom.lua.
-- It cannot prove that the widget actually asks for that arithmetic, because
-- it cannot load bookshelf_widget.lua. That gap is not theoretical: the gap
-- accessor used to return Size.line.thin restated locally, and the pure test
-- hardcoded scaleBySize(0.5) alongside it. Reverting the accessor to PAD --
-- which drops a 1248x1648 panel from 27 rows to 10, below the cover grid's 12
-- and straight back into the failure list view exists to fix -- left the whole
-- suite green.
--
-- So the two accessors are extracted by name and run under stubs, the same way
-- _test_jump_scan_list and _test_select_all_view drive their methods. What is
-- asserted is the WIRING: that the budget is built from ListGeom's own
-- declarations rather than from numbers restated in the widget.
