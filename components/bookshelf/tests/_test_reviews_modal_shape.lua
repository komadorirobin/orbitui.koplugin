-- bookshelf_reviews_modal.lua needs the full widget stack to load, so these
-- read the source -- named as such, per the repo's convention. The behaviour
-- itself was driven offscreen (footer order, the at-top yield, the swipe
-- closing the modal); what these pin is that nobody quietly reverts the
-- decisions. Comment lines are stripped first so prose quoting the patterns
-- cannot satisfy a check.
